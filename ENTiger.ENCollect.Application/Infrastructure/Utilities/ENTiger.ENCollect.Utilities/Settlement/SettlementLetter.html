    <p>Dear {CustomerName},</p>
    <br />
    <p>This letter is to confirm that Bank and you, {CustomerName}, have mutually agreed to settle the outstanding dues pertaining to Loan Account No. {AgreementId}, under {Type} settlement arrangement.</p>
    <br />
    <p>As per our discussion and internal approval dated {ApprovalDate}, the following settlement terms have been agreed upon:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Original Loan Amount: ₹ {DisbursedAmount}</li>
        <li>Outstanding Dues: ₹ {OutstandingDues}</li>
        <li>Agreed Settlement Amount: ₹ {SettlementAmount}</li>
        <li>Last Date for Payment: {LastPaymentDate}</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
        Please note that this settlement is offered as a one-time measure to resolve the dues amicably.
        The settlement shall only be considered valid and binding upon realization of the full and final payment of the agreed settlement amount on or before the due date mentioned above.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Until such time as the agreed amount is paid in full, the loan account will continue to reflect as outstanding in our records and in the credit bureau reports. Upon successful payment within the stipulated timeline, the loan account will be updated as “Settled” in our system.</p>

        This letter does not constitute a No Objection Certificate (NOC) or a confirmation of closure.
        A separate confirmation will be issued upon full realization of the settlement amount.
